We have received fair warning that the the forthcoming release of dplyr (due for CRAN submission on April 25) may not be backwards compatible with denovolyzeR.  I will investigate this ASAP.
Until this is addressed users may need to keep an installation of dplyr 0.4.3 on their system in order to run denovolyzeR.
